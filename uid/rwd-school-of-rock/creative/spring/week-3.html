		<h2>Take Note</h2>

		<p>Some of the common flags that the development team raised in reviewing the homework assignments:</p>

		<h3>Problem: Content Parity</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<div>

				<img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/content-parity-small.jpg" alt="Content modules on small screen"/>

			</div>

			<div>

				<img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/content-parity-large.jpg" alt="Content modules on large screen"/>

			</div>

		</div>

		<br/>

		<ul>
			<li>Amount of content available varies based on screen size - all users do not see the same content modules</li>
			<li>Treats users on mobile browsers "second-class citizens of the web"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Solution: One Web for All</h3>

		<p>A responsive website is a single website with a single group of content items to be displayed on all screens. Do not pick and choose features to show on one screen size versus another. If it's good enough for large screens, it's good enough for small screens, and vice-versa. Images may change and layouts may shift, but the same text and functionality should always be available.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Problem: Gridlock</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<div>

				<img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/gridlock-small.jpg" alt="Tight grid layout on small screen"/>

			</div>

			<div>

				<img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/gridlock-large.jpg" alt="Tight grid layout on large screen"/>

			</div>

		</div>

		<br/>

		<ul>
			<li>Assumes that content will always be a certain length, and that all content modules will always be the same length in order to align perfectly</li>
			<li>Adding or removing copy in later site updates can skew layout</li>
			<li>Sets limits within the layout that prevent content from "flowing"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Potential Solutions:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Replace grid styles with a less constrained layout</li>
			<li>Keep modules, but make it clear in the mockups (especially those going to clients) that modules may not always align perfectly</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Problem: Merry-Go-Round?</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<div>

				<img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/carousel-small.jpg" alt="Carousel on small screen"/>

			</div>

			<div>

				<img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/carousel-large.jpg" alt="Carousel on large screen"/>

			</div>

		</div>

		<p>Using <a href="http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/">carousels</a> to present a group of information on both small and large screens is not an ideal solution:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Click-through and eye tracking studies demonstrate that user engagement with these features is low</li>
			<li>Move from left to right, when natural user motions within site are up and down (via either finger or mouse scroll)</li>
			<li>Take important information out of the user's view and puts it in a space they are less likely to see</li>
			<li>When large images are included, can add significant weight to a page and reduce load time</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Potential Solutions:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Content audit

				<ul>
					<li>Is all of this information relevant to the user?</li>
					<li>For carousel banners: Do all of these images add value? Is this content more important in the overall hierarchy than the main body copy and search functionalities?</li>
					<li>What is the message that all of this content is trying to convey? Can it be stated in a more condensed manner?</li>
				</ul>

			</li>
			<li>Alternate layout patterns

				<ul>
					<li>Expandable/collapsible panels (all headlines are shown at once)</li>
					<li>Display condensed version of content all at once on one page, link from there to separate pages to expand upon information</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="side-by-side">

					<div>

						<img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/mothercare-alternate-small.jpg" alt="Mothercare small screen wire"/>

					</div>

					<div>

						<img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/mothercare-alternate-large.jpg" alt="Mothercare large screen wire"/>

					</div>

		<h2>Highlights</h2>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<a href="../../img/aia/full/thales-wire-small.jpg" id="thales-hand"><div><img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/thales-wire-small.jpg" alt="Thales small screen wires"/></div></a>

			<a href="../../img/aia/full/thales-wire-large.jpg"><img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/thales-wire-large.jpg" alt="Thales large screen wires"/></a>

		</div>

		<br/>

		<ul>
			<li>Priority given to major site functions (job search and subscribe)</li>
			<li>Consistent content across all screen sizes</li>
			<li>Included user in wires (hover over first image to view)</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<a href="../../img/aia/full/thales-small.jpg"><img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/thales-small.jpg" alt="Thales small screen mock"/></a>

			<a href="../../img/aia/full/thales-large.jpg"><img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/thales-large.jpg" alt="Thales large screen mock"/></a>

		</div>

		<br/>

		<ul>
			<li>Flexible navigation pattern that does not require major style changes from small to large screens</li>
			<li>Simplified, smaller images for smaller screens</li>
			<li>Consistent content across all screen sizes</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<div class="side-by-side taller-smallscreen">

			<a href="../../img/aia/full/thales-single-small.jpg"><img class="smallscreen" src="../../img/aia/thales-single-small.jpg" alt="Thales single column small screen mock"/></a>

			<a href="../../img/aia/full/thales-single-large.jpg"><img class="largescreen" src="../../img/aia/thales-single-large.jpg" alt="Thales single column large screen mock"/></a>

		</div>

		<br/>

		<ul>
			<li>Single-column layout on all screen sizes</li>
			<li>Very consistent cross-device experience that emphasizes mobile-first</li>
			<li>May be challenging with more complex/information-heavy home pages, but worth experimenting with</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Respond to Responsive</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Was working with a mobile-first mindset significantly different from your normal approach to design?</li>
			<li>Which approach do you prefer, and why?</li>
			<li>What was one of the major challenges you encountered in creating your responsive designs?</li>
			<li>Did you reach out to your developer contact at all as you were designing?</li>
		</ul>

	</div>

<section id="now-what">

	<div>

		<h2>Now what?</h2>

		<h3>The Creative Challenge</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Share responsive designs to clients with mobile-first mockups</li>
			<li>Get clients to start thinking about the mobile experience first</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Moving forward</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>What kinds of information/assets would be helpful for you to have when beginning a responsive design?</li>
			<li>Do you feel that other members of your project teams (project managers, account directors, etc.) have a good understanding of RWD? If not, what do you think they need to learn more about?</li>
			<li>How can the development team best help the creative team in bringing responsive sites from initial concept to final launch?</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Keeping up</h3>

		<p>Responsive design and development are fluid concepts themselves. New devices, layout patterns, and development technologies are constantly forcing RWD to evolve and expand its design potential. Check out the <a href="../../extra-credit.html">Extra Credit page</a> for some resources to help you stay up to date with all things responsive.</p>
