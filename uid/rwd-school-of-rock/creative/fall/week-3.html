<section id="note">

	<div>

		<h2>Take Note</h2>

		<p>Some of the common flags that the development team raised in reviewing last session's homework:</p>

		<h3>Problem: Tiny footer links</h3>

		<a id="pointer" href="#pointer"><img src="../../img/issues-footerlinks.jpg" alt="tiny footer links" class="issue-mobile"/></a>

		<h3>Potenial solutions:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Increase font size of link text</li>
			<li>Add more padding/spacing between links</li>
			<li>Make links larger and move into an expandable/collapsible section, to avoid visual clutter</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Problem: Content order</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/merrymaids-issue-small.jpg"><img src="../../img/issues-content-1.jpg" alt="Element order on small screen" class="smallscreen"/></a>

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/merrymaids-issue-large.jpg"><img src="../../img/issues-content-2.jpg" alt="Element order on large screen" class="largescreen"/></a>

		</div>

		<h3>Potential solution: Reorder content</h3>

		<img class="issue-mobile" src="../../img/issues-content-3.jpg" alt="Mobile elements reordered"/>

		<ul>
			<li>Consistent cross-device content hierarchy</li>
			<li>More focus on jobs, less focus on social</li>
			<li>There may be some cases where content order needs to change based on screen size, to meet different user needs. In general, designs should maintain consistency. If you encounter an exception/special case, discuss possible solutions with your friendly neighborhood developer.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Problem: Tight grids</h3>

		<p>If the user resizes text within the browser, a horizontally-aligned grid layout can fall apart.</p>

		<p>Before text resize:</p>

		<img class="issue-desktop" src="../../img/issues-grid-1.jpg" alt="tight grid layout before text resize"/>

		<p>After text resize:</p>

		<img class="issue-desktop" src="../../img/issues-grid-2.jpg" alt="tight grid layout after text resize"/>

		<h3>Potential solutions:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Having unevenly-sized content modules is absolutely acceptable in your design - the mockup should not set the expectation of a perfectly aligned grid</li>
			<li>Allow content modules to have variable heights (see job descriptions on <a href="http://jobsattmp.com/">jobsattmp.com</a>)

				<img class="issue-desktop" src="../../img/issues-grid-3.jpg" alt="modules with variable heights"/>

			</li>
			<li>Avoid precisely-sized container layouts for text content</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Problem: The Lone Hamburger</h3>

		<p>The small screen version has a menu button, but there is no corresponding main menu on either the small or large screen layout.</p>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<div>

				<img src="../../img/issues-burger-1.jpg" alt="smallscreen view with hamburger nav button"/>

			</div>

			<div>

				<img src="../../img/issues-burger-2.jpg" alt="large screen view with no menu"/>

			</div>

		</div>

		<h3>Potential solution: Know thy content</h3>

		<p>Not every mobile site needs to have a main menu or a mobile nav setup. If your site content structure is simple enough that users do not need any kind of global navigation, then do not include one in the site design.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Problem: Content parity</h3>

		<p>Different screen sizes display different branding messages:</p>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<div>

				<img src="../../img/issue-content-1.jpg" alt="smallscreen view with second search and different copy"/>

			</div>

			<div>

				<img src="../../img/issue-content-2.jpg" alt="large screen view with different headline"/>

			</div>

		</div>

		<h3>Potential solution: One content, many devices</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Content that is considered "good" for small screens is "good" for large screens (and vice versa)</li>
			<li>Keep branding messages and features consistent across all screen sizes</li>
			<li>Do not treat users of any device (mobile or desktop, small screen or large) as "second-class citizens of the web"</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Star Students</h2>

		<h3>Design:</h3>

		<a href="../../img/full-designs/sketch-full.jpg"><img class="issue-desktop" src="../../img/sketch.jpg" alt="Merrymaids sketch mockups"/></a>

		<h3>Highlights:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Going back to the basics in sketching concepts puts focus on content rather than on pixels and presentation</li>
			<li>Notes content order and ideas for functionality - solid jumping-off point for a full design</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Design:</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/ericsson-smallscreen.jpg"><img src="../../img/ericsson-1.jpg" alt="Ericsson small screen view" class="smallscreen"/></a>

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/ericsson-largescreen.jpg"><img src="../../img/ericsson-2.jpg" alt="Ericsson large screen view" class="largescreen"/></a>

		</div>

		<h3>Highlights:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Order of elements fits recommendations to keep most timely and popular elements first, less pressing elements later</li>
			<li>Old-fashioned hover menus for category list replaced by expandable lists</li>
			<li>Limited use of background images</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Design:</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/hp-smallscreen.jpg"><div class="hp-smallscreen"></div></a>

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/hp-largescreen.jpg"><img src="../../img/hp-menu-3.jpg" alt="HP large screen view" class="largescreen"/></a>

		</div>

		<h3>Highlights:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Consistent transition of content priority from small screens to large screens</li>
			<li>Effectively condenses a complex top nav structure when screen space is limited (with space to increase size of links within nav)</li>
			<li>Keeps search functions prominent on both views</li>
			<li>Maintains branding without sacrificing too much visual real estate or using large images</li>
		</ul>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Design:</h3>

		<div class="side-by-side">

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/multicare-smallscreen.jpg"><div class="multi-smallscreen"></div></a>

			<a href="../../img/full-designs/multicare-largescreen.jpg"><img src="../../img/multicare-2.jpg" alt="Multicare large screen view" class="largescreen"/></a>

		</div>

		<h3>Highlights:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Effective use of expandable content areas &amp; color accents to distinguish content areas</li>
			<li>Progressively enhanced video section - smaller screens only display some video thumbs with a “See all videos” callout (links to another page with all videos)</li>
			<li>Uses native browser form inputs for better cross-browser/cross-device compatibility and usability</li>
			<li>Text links adequately spaced apart to avoid “fat-finger” user mistakes</li>
		</ul>

<section id="feedback">

	<div>

		<h2>Respond to Responsive</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Was working with a mobile-first mindset significantly different from your normal approach to design?</li>
			<li>Which approach do you prefer, and why?</li>
			<li>What was one of the major challenges you encountered in creating your responsive designs?</li>
			<li>Did you reach out to your developer contact at all as you were designing?</li>
		</ul>

	</div>

<section id="now-what">

	<div>

		<h2>Now what?</h2>

		<h3>The Creative Challenge</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Share responsive designs to clients with mobile-first mockups</li>
			<li>Get clients to start thinking about the mobile experience first</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Moving forward</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>What kinds of information/assets would be helpful for you to have when beginning a responsive design?</li>
			<li>Do you feel that other members of your project teams (project managers, account directors, etc.) have a good understanding of RWD? If not, what do you think they need to learn more about?</li>
			<li>How can the development team best help the creative team in bringing responsive sites from initial concept to final launch?</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Keeping up</h3>

		<p>Responsive design and development are fluid concepts themselves. New devices, layout patterns, and development technologies are constantly forcing RWD to evolve and expand its design potential. Check out the <a href="../../extra-credit.html">Extra Credit page</a> for some resources to help you stay up to date with all things responsive.</p>
