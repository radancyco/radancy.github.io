		<h2>Need For Speed</h2>

		<h3>The Numbers</h3>

		<p>According to a <a href="http://e-commercefacts.com/research/2011/07/what-usrs-want-from-mobil/19986_WhatMobileUsersWant_Wp.pdf">2011 Compuware survey</a>:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>58% of U.S. mobile web users expect that websites should load in <strong>3 seconds or less</strong></li>
			<li>46% of mobile web users will abandon a site if it does not load after <strong>4 seconds</strong></li>
			<li>77% of top companies have mobile page load times of <strong>more than 5 seconds</strong></li>
			<li>61% of users said poor performance would discourage them from visiting mobile sites</li>
			<li>80% of users would use mobile sites more if performance was better</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Sum</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Users want fast mobile web experiences, and most companies are not living up to their audiences' expectations</li>
			<li>Companies that have properly optimized sites can put themselves in an incredibly competitive position in their industry's recruitment market</li>

		<h2>The Content Diet</h2>

		<p>Careful selection and optimization of site content can also have a significant effect on the costs of hosting and maintaining that site. Designs that are light on content and heavy on images, for example, can have a negative financial impact.</p>

		<p>This graph shows impact on bandwidth usage of a heavily-trafficked careers site before and after the addition of a large image carousel on the homepage. The spike in bandwidth after the introduction of the feature was not due to increased user traffic - it was due to downloads of the carousel images.</p>

		<img id="bandwidth" src="../img/bandwidth.jpg" alt="bandwidth usage chart before/after introduction of image carousel">

		<p>Increased bandwidth usage translates to higher hosting costs. <strong>The 4 images in the site's carousel were adding an additional $3,600 per year to operating costs.</strong></p>

		<p>Remember, this is only one site of the many that contribute to total bandwidth costs. If every site were to include such high-resolution media modules, the annual costs would be multiplied - all for the purpose of serving up images that add little rich content to the overall user experience.</p>

		<h2>SEO: Users First</h2>

		<p>SEO is no longer a game of page links and keywords. Modern search engine algorithms rank pages based on content relevancy and ease of access. In other words, search engines are looking to see <strong>how useful your page actually is to the end user</strong>.</p>

		<p>In discussing responsive design, we tend to focus on two strategies for conceptualizing, designing, and developing websites:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Mobile First</strong> - treating the mobile browsing experience as the baseline experience for all users, and progressively enhancing the same content with additional functionality and imagery on larger screen sizes</li>
			<li><strong>Content First</strong> - keeping the limited screen space of mobile browsing in mind and structuring page layout so that the main page content is positioned as close to the top of the page as possible</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Both ideas stem from one central root: <strong>Users First</strong>. Mobile first thinking gives users what they need in the format most relevant to the device they are using, and content first thinking ensures that they can quickly locate the information they want.</p>

		<p>Maximizing SEO for responsive websites is incredibly simple: <strong>focus on <em>users first</em>, and search engines will follow them naturally to your site</strong>.</p>
