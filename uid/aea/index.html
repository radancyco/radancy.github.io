				<ol class="commandments">
					
					<li>Thou shalt entertain
						<ul>
							<li>Relevant illustrations (see AEA website) - visual art is the international language</li>
							<li>Playful <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/404">404</a> <a href="http://stephanieplumeri.net/404.html">pages</a></li>
							<li>Humanize the experience by adding little copy touches (e.g. the dynamic multi-lingual greeting on Flickr's old site.)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Test everything (including assumptions)
						<ul>
							<li>Build a device lab</li>
							<li><a href="http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/remote-preview/">Remote preview</a> - javascript program for shadowing on multiple devices</li>

							<li>Don't work in isolation</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Thou shalt iterate
						<ul>
							<li>In your design, move things around until they look right</li>
							<li>A site is never "done"</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Thou shalt ship
						<ul>
							<li>If you let pixel-perfection hold up delivery, your competition will get the best of you</li>
							<li>Ship, then tweak in the next iteration</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Engage thy community
						<ul>
							<li>This does not mean shoving social sharing options down your user's throats</li>
							<li>Know who your audience is, and base your design/structure to cater to their tastes and needs</li>
							<li><a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/embeddable-comments-yes-please">Embeddable comments</a> drive traffic between your site and other sites while engaging the community - interact, don't just sell</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Love thy user as thyself
						<ul>
							<li>We have the technology (CSS, Javascript, server-side) to meet the user and give them the same experience regardless of how they are accessing your content</li>
							<li>Just give the user what they want, where they want, without dumbing anything down</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Remember the content and keep it holy
						<ul>
							<li>Getting the right content to the right user at the right time</li>
							<li>Anything in the design that detracts from that should be cut; remove every distraction you possibly can</li>
							<li>Sites such as the NYTimes online are paring down and going to a cleaner, more content-focused layout</li>

					<li>Thou shalt make magic</li>
					<li>Thou shalt prioritize</li>
					<li>To thine own self be true

				<h3><a class="title" href="#mcgrane">The Mobile Content Mandate</a></h3>
				<a class="speaker" href="http://aneventapart.com/speakers/karen-mcgrane">Karen McGrane</a>
				<div>
				<q>Good content transcends platform.</q><cite>Karen McGrane</cite>
				<p><strong>Disruptive innovation</strong> happens from the low end of the market. New products, which are generally shoddily-made and of lower quality than their high-end counterparts, enter the market. Users are willing to accept the lower quality as a tradeoff for lower price, and technology makes its way into the hands of people who never had it before. Over time, this disrupts the market for the higher-end product. The quality of the low-end product gradually improves, and eventually the formerly "shoddy" device overtakes the market.</p>
				
				<p>Who is willing to make that tradeoff?</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>20%</strong> of Americans have <strong>no Internet access at all</strong></li>
					<li><strong>35%</strong> have no Internet access at home</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>In-home Internet access may be limited, but mobile web access is much more widespread.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>88%</strong> of Americans own a mobile phone</li>
					<li><strong>55%</strong> of Americans use their mobile device to go online. Of those Americans, <strong>31% only or mostly use the Internet on that mobile device</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Ignoring mobile in developing your content strategy turns a significant portion of your user base into "second-class citizens". Which doesn't mean you should panic and throw up a mobile website tomorrow - in fact, that would be equally as useless to your users.</p>
				<h4>Content strategy for mobile:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't silo off mobile as a separate workflow - all changes for desktop and mobile should be considered in tandem</li>
					<li>If you write good content, all users become first-class citizens in your mobile web nation</li>
					<li>Don't rely on responsive <em>design</em> to solve mobile <em>content</em> problems</li>
					<li>There's no such thing as "how to write for mobile" - there's just good writing</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Chunk Your Blobs</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Content shouldn't be specifically associated with any part of the layout of a web page</li>
					<li>Questions to ask/consider:
						<ul>
							<li>Which content should be included or excluded?</li>
							<li>Should longer pages be broken into shorter ones?</li>
							<li>Will it work to reuse headings as links?</li>
							<li>Will it work to truncate body copy for teasers? (Example: This doesn't work for Amazon's mobile site; the truncated body copy has no value since product names and specs are just repeated.)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Daily Beast, NPR, and The Guardian <a href="http://guardiantruncationteam.tumblr.com">truncate headlines</a> rather than giving them proper real estate on mobile.</li>
					<li>Either give headlines more real estate, or write shorter headlines</li>
					<li>Netflix is a great example of chunked content - shows the appropriate amount of detail/content for a given platform</li>

				<div>
				<q>People post about cats on Facebook, watch videos about cats on YouTube, and tweet about cats on Twitter.</q>
				<q>If people 'consume' content, where does it go when they're done with it? Think about it.</q>
				<cite>Luke Wroblewski</cite>
				<p>The top websites in the world, as ranked by audience, are all <strong>write/read experiences</strong> - they depend on the users adding (writing) content to them. How do we keep people contributing as the web shifts to the mobile environment?</p>
				<p>Here, have some numbers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>67%</strong> of Facebook users and <strong>60%</strong> of Twitter users are browsing on mobile devices</li>
					<li>In 2011, <strong>40%</strong> of all tweets were created on mobile</li>
					<li><strong>40%</strong> of videos watched on YouTube are being viewed on a mobile device (that's 2 out of every 5 videos)</li>
					<li><strong>30%</strong> of Facebook India users access the site <strong>only on mobile</strong></li>
					<li><strong>52%</strong> of US laptop owners also have a smartphone</li>
					<li>Mobile users spend <strong>12%</strong> of their browsing time shopping and <strong>11%</strong> of their time managing finances/health - mobile is not just about entertainment!</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="img/mobile_facebook_lukew.jpg" alt="graph of mobile facebook use over time">
				<p>The mobile web isn't going away. So, how do we design for mobile creation?</p>
				<ol>
					<li>One handed use
						<ul>
							<li>"The ergonomics of software design"</li>
							<li>Behavioral study of mobile phone "posture":
								<ul>
									<li>49% of users use only one hand, one thumb</li>
									<li>36% use one hand to hold the phone and one to navigate (either thumb or index finger)</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Smart suggestions and defaults to avoid forcing the user to use the keyboard - deliver the same information with fewer taps</li>
							<li>Test with one thumb!</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Focused flows
						<ul>
							<li>Constantly iterate and review the user interface to eliminate unnecessary steps and reduce the taps to get from Point A to Point B</li>
							<li>boingo saw a 40% increase in mobile conversions when they reduced the number of input fields on their online sign up form</li>
							<li>HotelTonight allows users to write reviews using photos rather than typing them out</li>
							<li>If you're making a lot of people uncomfortable with a big design decision, you're probably on the right track</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Just in time actions
						<ul>
							<li>Don't open your app with instructions on how to use it - it blocks their use of the app, and they won't pay attention to the tutorial anyway</li>
							<li>Show tips relevant to the actions the user is taking/the content being viewed</li>
							<li>"Education in context"</li>
							<li>Example: When you start scrolling down in the Google+ app, the navigation bar jumps out of the way (but comes back when you start scrolling back up)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Cross device usage
						<ul>
							<li>Not just about design</li>
							<li>Multiple devices can be used together for a cohesive input experience</li>
							<li>Backend technologies to track sessions across different devices - Google Chrome on desktop/mobile is a great example</li>
						</ul>

				<h3><a class="title" href="#keith">The Long Web</a></h3>
				<a class="speaker" href="http://aneventapart.com/speakers/jeremy-keith">Jeremy Keith</a>
				<div>
				<q>The written word is probably the greatest invention of the human race</q><cite>Jeremy Keith</cite>
				<p>Although language and technology has changed significantly since the early days of human communication, the basic idea of text-based communication is the same: writing is a storehouse of knowledge put down in text that can transfer to other humans in other places.</p>
				
				<p>Relying on progressively-enhanced, plain-text HTML, semanitc markup, and CSS make for better websites - in the worst-case scenario, one feature is not rendered exactly as expected. If you rely on javascript for basic functionality, you are setting up a "single point of failure" that could break your entire site.</p>
				
				<p>There are plenty of amazing ways developers can use basic markup to do some cool stuff that doesn't break on browsers that cannot interpret all of the language. <strong>Remember, the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first website on the Internet</a> is still online</strong>, and validates as proper HTML5 markup despite being built <strong>years</strong> before the HTML5 language was established.</p>
				
				<h4>URL First</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>URLs are the universal syntax of the web</li>
					<li>Make your URLS guessable, hackable, understandable - they are the API of exploring your website</li>
					<li>Take advantage of query string options and logical URL subdirectories to make your content easily searchable/accessible</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Navigation Second</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Put your navigation list at the bottom of the document, under your content</li>
					<li>On mobile, use an anchor link at the top of the page to bring users to the main menu</li>
					<li>On desktop, you can use CSS to send your menu back up to the top of the page</li>
					<li>Serves as a good base because anchor links are basic HTML functionality, and work on every browser</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>No secrets</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Why do password inputs on websites hide what you are typing? Unless someone is looking over your shoulder, no one else will see your password.</li>
					<li>More user-friendly to show password on input, with an option to hide it if the user is in a situation where his/her screen is in view of others</li>
					<li>Goes against web conventions for login... but are the conventions always the best practice for the user?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Shiny new HTML5 toys</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Input types help in small ways to make mobile input easier - devices interpret markup and show the input options that are most relevant to user</li>
					<li><code>inputmode</code> attribute to specify type of input you want:
						<ul>
							<li><code>&lt;input type="number" inputmode="numeric"/&gt;</code> shows the iOS telephone keyboard without symbols</li>
							<li>Not supported on a lot of browsers/devices - interim hack for iOS is <code>&lt;input type="number" pattern="[0-9]"/&gt;</code></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>HTML5 <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/5663/"><code>datalist</code></a> element - add under an input to set options that show up as possible input values when you start typing
						<ul>
							<li>Build-your-own custom autofill</li>
							<li>Progressively enhanced - user can still input if browser doesn't support <code>datalist</code>, they just won't see suggestions</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><code>placeholder</code> attribute for text inputs - not as new, but an easy way to show users an example of the type of value should input into a particular field</li>
					<li>SVG - text-based image format
						<ul>
							<li>Not HTML5 markup, but still a shiny toy indeed</li>
							<li>Can put Javascript and CSS/media queries inside of SVG</li>
							<li>Will be around for a long time because it is human-readable</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>				
				<p><strong>The best way to be future-friendly is to be backwards-compatible.</strong></p>

				<div>
				<q>Every project is a map we make of a problem we're trying to solve</q><cite>Ethan Marcotte</cite>
				<p>A map is a representation of a territory that used to be strange. Every web project you undertake is an uncharted territory that you have to map out. The terrain gets a little more rocky when we add considerations for device fragmentation into the mix.</p>
				
				<p>Responsive design helps us meet the audience <strong>wherever they are, whenever they are</strong>.</p>

				<h4>Core elements of responsive design/development:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Fluid Grid
						<ul>
							<li>Size elements with percentages, not pixels</li>
							<li>target / context = result</li>
							<li>Learn to love <code>:nth-child</code></li>
							<li>As the viewport size changes, the pixel sizes change, but the content proportions stay the same</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Media queries
						<ul>
							<li>Base your breakpoints on the content itself - where your "stress points" are, where the layout starts to break</li>
							<li>Device-agnostic, plans for growth in the future</li>
							<li>When planning element positioning, sort tasks into logical groups - what elements/features/functionalities should always live together?</li>
							<li>Defend the integrity of your content</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4>Responsive by numbers: <a href="http://skinnyties.com/">skinnyties.com</a> responsive redesign</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>42.4% revenue growth for all devices</li>
					<li>44.6% increased visit duration</li> 					<li><strong>377.6% revenue growth</strong> for iPhone</li>
					<li>13.6% increase in conversion rates for all devices</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Responsive by numbers: website obesity epidemic</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Average site weight in 2009: <strong>320KB</strong></li>
					<li>Average site weight in 2013: <strong>1.4MB</strong></li>
					<li>Complex responsive sites are impressive in both design and weight: <a href="http://moto.oakley.com/">moto.oakley.com</a> weighs in at <strong>8MB</strong>, Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro promo site</a> came in at a whopping <strong>33MB</strong>.</li>
					<li>Remember: as site load time increase, conversion rates decrease</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>A closer look at the map</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>We generally phrase use of mobile devices in Western terms, but we have to consider device use in other portions of the world</li>
					<li>Western assumption is that devices are <em>personal</em> and <em>always online</em></li>
					<li>In Dhaka, Bangladesh, devices are often shared - people rent time to use mobile devices to access the web</li>
					<li>Remote villages in Kenya have a single community phone - when it runs out of power, they send a runner to the nearest village to acquire resources to recharge it</li>
					<li>Most of the networks in the world are lower-end - our designs need to keep these slower, emerging networks in mind</li>
					<li>The number of mobile web users in the developing world has <strong>grown 27 times since 2007</strong></li>
					<li>If we want to reach all of the users on the map, we cannot rely on the Western assumptions of personal computing, constant connection, and high-bandwidth access</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Sustainable web design</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Progressive enhancement to promote future growth without leaving audiences behind - a "defense mechanism" for your content</li>
					<li>Reduce and revisit your site code/content often</li>
					<li>Some web diet aids:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon">grunticon</a> - generate CSS for scalable SVG icons with fallbacks for older browsers</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.grumpicon.com/">grumpicon.com</a> - web application for grunticon
							<li>Leverage CSS over images whenever possible</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Accept the ebb and flow of things - there are many points of failure in the web, and our design practices need to embrace that</li>
					<li>"Beauty" on the web needs to be defined by how broadly it can be accessed, not just how visually striking it is</li>

				<p>A <strong>"framework for collaboration"</strong> can provide a way for us to think about how - and why - we work together. One of the greatest predictors of a team's achievement is how the members feel about one another and work together. On the flip side, difficulties in team collaboration and lack of a defined workflow can be one of the greatest challenges in a project (especially one involving responsive web development).</p>
				<h4>Defining the framework:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Objectives
						<ul>
							<li>A concrete goal</li>
							<li>Defined in the social sphere as a personal/shared gain, in the business shere as a customer success or cost savings</li>
							<li>Example for a bank = Increase assets by 15%</li>
							<li>In any business, objectives come from the top and need to be articulated <em>clearly</em></li>
							<li>Activity is not productivity - the team needs to know <strong>"why are we doing this"</strong> in order to make any progress towards reaching your objectives</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				
					<li>Strategy
						<ul>
							<li>"Rally cry" for the team</li>
							<li>A shared, long-term direction for short-term goals and activities</li>
							<li>Not the full details of every logistical aspect of the process, just a general overarching theme to guide your decision-making</li>
							<li>Look at the initial asks for the project and prioritize them based on how relevant they are to that strategy</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Principles
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">gov.uk design principles</a> are a good example</li>
							<li>Rules, documentation, agreed-upon terminology</li>
							<li>Helps define values and keep team accountable to them</li>
							<li>Not "be innovative" or vague terms - principles must be actionable and applicable to real life</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Roles
						<ul>
							<li>Not necessarily distinct people - the positions on the team that need to be filled</li>
							<li>Think more about available skill sets as opposed to how roles are defined within a given process (waterfall vs. agile)</li>
							<li>The RACI model
								<ul>
									<li>R - Who is responsible for completing a task</li>
									<li>A - who is accountable for the work's success</li>
									<li>C - who must be consulted before work can be signed off on</li>
									<li>I - who must be kept informed along the way</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Perceptions
						<ul>
							<li>You can only communicate with someone on their own terms</li>
							<li>Understand what the listeners (other team members) think and speak to that</li>
							<li>More than just shared terminology: being able to explain yourself and being brave enough to ask for clarification from others</li>
						</ul>

				<h3><a class="title" href="#spool">It's a Great Time To Be a UX Designer</a></h3>
				<a class="speaker" href="http://aneventapart.com/speakers/jared-spool">Jared Spool</a>
				<div>
				<q>Design is the rendering of intent.</q><cite>Jared Spool</cite>
				
				<h4>Why does everybody want to be like an Apple store?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Knockoff stores in china, Microsoft stores in the US, stores-within-stores in JCPenney</li>
					<li>2012 retail performance of Apple stores was <strong>$6,050/sq. ft.</strong>, compared to $341/sq. ft. for the average mall store and $3,017/sq. ft. for Tiffany &amp; Co</li>
					<li>Every aspect of the Apple store shopping experience has been <em>designed for a specific purpose</em> - highly calculated and <em>intentional</em></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Intention can be measured on a spectrum from <strong>pure imitation</strong> to <strong>pure innovation</strong>.</p>
				
				<h4>Imitation</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Less expensive</li>
					<li>Less risky</li>
					<li>Design not valued</li>
					<li>Viewed as a commodity</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Innovation</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>More expensive</li>
					<li>More risky</li>
					<li>Design heavily valued</li>
					<li>Viewed as competitive</li>
					<li><strong>Much bigger payoff</strong></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Design is no longer about the visual - it is about the <em>business</em> as a whole. Businesses are now looking for designers to design their <em>entire business model</em>, not just their products.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Innovation is not adding new inventions, it is adding new value.</strong> Apple took existing concepts (appointments) and applied them to their business model in a way that added value (scheduling appointments at the Genius bar).</p>
				
				<img src="img/apple_design.jpg" alt="Consumer Journey for a Defective Product">
				
				<p><strong>Experience design</strong> is the rendering of intent within the gaps. A good experience designer must be familiar with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information architecture</li>
					<li>User research practices</li>
					<li>Visual design</li>
					<li>Interaction design</li>
					<li>Design process management</li>
					<li>Copywriting</li>
					<li>Editing &amp; curating</li>
					<li>Technology</li>
					<li>Social networks</li>
					<li>Analytics</li>
					<li>Development processes (agile/waterfall)</li>
					<li>Business needs</li>
					<li>User needs</li>
					<li>Storytelling</li>
					<li>Sketching</li>
					<li>Critiquing</li>
					<li>Presenting</li>
					<li>...and more - the list continues to grow.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Teams need more generalists than specialists. UX generalists are "unicorns", but <strong>we can all become unicorns</strong> with time, practice, effort, and passion for our field:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Train yourself</li>
					<li>Practice your skills</li>
					<li>Deconstruct as many designs as you can</li>
					<li>Seek out feedback (and listen to it)</li>
					<li>Teach others (you learn something when you teach something)</li>

				<a class="speaker" href="http://aneventapart.com/speakers/jason-santa-maria">Jason Santa Maria</a>
				<div>
				<q>This scared the hell out of me.</q>
				<cite>Jason Santa Maria on his first time bringing design into the browser early in the process</cite>
				<q>Let's change the phrase 'designing in the browser' to 'deciding in the browser'</q><cite>Dan Mall</cite>
				<p>Every project is different, and the design process should depend upon your team, your client and the manner in which all parties involved work best.</p>
				<p>There is no set IKEA-like instruction booklet for design. (Did they sponsor this event?)</p>
				<p>The linear process (plan > design > code > launch) is the <em>old process</em>. When Jason asked who in the room still followed such a linear process, only a few timid hands were raised in a room full of hundreds of designers/developers.</p>
				<p>Here's what the new process should look like:</p>
				<img src="img/santamaria_flowchart.jpg" alt="Nimble process design flowchart">
				
				<strong>Where NOT to start:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Details such as grids or libraries</li>
					<li>Don't limit yourself too early on - it prevents you from integrating other ideas you may have later on</li>
					<li>Photoshop - "Never draw anything you can copy, never copy anything you can trace. never trace anything you can cut out and paste up."</li>
				</ul>
				
				<strong>Where to start:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Paper - get out a sketchbook and challenge yourself to create as many permutations of a concept as possible</li>
					<li>Content - gather your assets</li>
					<li>Type (think back to style tiles and check out <a href="http://typecast.com/">typecast</a>)</li>

				<div>
				<q>Every time someone asks a designer to 'just make it pretty', a baby kitten <strong>DIES</strong>.</q>
				<cite>Samantha Warren</cite>
				<p>The web is different, so we need to think about design differently.</p>
				<h4>Problems:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Tension between good design and deadlines - need to work efficiently</li>
					<li>Designing for an infinite number of devices</li>
					<li>"Frankencomps" - font from A, image from B, and so on</li>
					<li>Different adjectives mean different things to different people: 'newsy', 'clean', 'playful'</li>
					<li>Moodboards can be too vague, comps/mockups can be too specific</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Solution - Style Tiles:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors, and interface elements that communicate the essense of a visual brand for the web</li>
					<li>Design <em>systems</em>, not <em>pages</em></li>
					<li>Separate style and structure</li>
					<li>Avoid getting hung up on one color/font/device width</li>
					<li>Consistent point of reference for large project teams</li>
				</ul>
				
				<img src="img/style_tile_example.jpg" alt="example style tile">
				<h4>The Process:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Listen
						<ul>
							<li>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikea_Effect">The IKEA Effect</a>": Involving the client lets them feel like the site has more value to them</li>
							<li>Make sure all stakeholders are involved from the very beginning - have them all meet together to make sure everyone is on the same page</li>
							<li>Find out the client's top 3 <em>user goals</em> (separate from style preferences)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Interpret
						<ul>
							<li>Identify common themes</li>
							<li>Aggregate adjectives from client answers</li>
						</ul>
					</li>				
					<li>Define a visual language
						<ul>
							<li>Pair colors/shapes/imagery with your adjectives</li>
							<li>Deliver possible icons, buttons, colors, imagery, examples of links</li>

					<q>Your job isn't just making things, that's the easy part! It's convincing people that the s*** you thought up in the shower that morning is right.</q>
					<cite>Mike Monteiro</cite>
					
					<h4>Designers</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Designers are people who exist in service industry - you have clients and they need your help</li>
						<li>We get irritated by having to explain</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Clients &amp; Designers</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Put yourself in your clients' less stylish shoes</li> 
						<li>You cannot change how others behave, but you can change how you behave and react to a situation to meet a common goal</li> 
						<li>Clients don't know when to get a designer involved</li>
						<li>"As long as you act like a disenfranchised 'creative,' that's how you deserve to be treated."</li>
						<li>Eye rolling and complaining are not a design skills</li>
						<li>"They never asked me" is not a design skill</li>
						<li>Clients don't know the best way to evaluate a designer</li>
						<li>"Sell [clients] the services you provide, using your sites as props."</li>
						<li>Be upfront and let clients know if you're not the right person for the job</li>
						<li>Every job you do is a sales pitch for the next job</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Clients are in your good hands</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn to say <em>no</em></li> 
						<li>Learn to ask <em>why</em></li> 
						<li>Learn to say <em>I don't know</em></li>
						<li>Clients want to see the outcome of a particular design challenge(comps)</li> 
						<li>Designers need to walk clients backwards from the conclusion to truly address the issue they are trying to solve</li>
						<li>Design is a solution to a problem within a set of constraints - not just fonts and images</li>
						<li>Letting a client tell you how to do your job is stupid</li>
						<li>No one is born a good client, just like no one is born a good designer</li>
						<li>The way to become a better designer is to help clients become better clients - working together with mutual respect can fix any problem you set your mind to</li>

				<div>
				<q>If there is a coming zombie apocalypse of devices, then TVs are likely the next wave.</q>
				<q>We can no longer make assumptions about input based on screen size or form factor. And we probably never should have.</q>
				<cite>Jason Grigsby</cite>
				<p>With all of those other screens out there, what happens to TV?</p>
				<p>Right now, TV is dumb, so users augment the experience with their other devices. <strong>88% of tablet owners</strong> and <strong>86% of smartphone owners</strong> use their device while watching TV.</p>
				<h4>The challenges:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Native device HTML5 and CSS3 support is still spotty</li>
					<li>Inputs - keyboard remotes with too many buttons or "Apple-fied" remotes with only one or two buttons that do not give users a lot of control options</li>
					<li>Cannot reliably detect input type (on all devices, not just TVs)</li>
					<li>Multi-device interaction</li>
					<li>Design for a massive display being viewed from 10 feet away</li>
					<li>Inconsistent screen resolutions</li>
					<li>Device testing - you can test designs on mobile devices at cell phone carrier stores, but can't do the same for smart TVs since none of them have remotes or a Wi-Fi connection at stores</li>
					<li>What are people actually expecting when they buy a smart TV? 
						<ul>
							<li>Storage capacity and processor speed aren't listed as specs</li>
							<li>Do most people just want built-in Netflix?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Possible/upcoming solutions:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>CSS spec for Opera to note what happens when you navigate via D-pad remote (but not a lot of TVs support that spec)
						<code>#copyright { nav-down: #logo; }</code>
						</li>
					<li>Google TV originally suggested replacing &lt;a&gt; tags with &lt;div&gt; elements with href attributes to handle TV-specific interaction - the Chrome team is now working on this project and considers that suggestion an "embarassment"</li>
					<li>Both of the above require a layer of CSS or JS to support input</li>
					<li>Device detection is the lesser of the evils for targeting TVs - CSS media types are not recognized frequently, and Javascript can't help us out</li>
					<li><strong>Design for user needs, not for input</strong></li>

				<div>
				<q>You may be thinking, 'is this girl really going to talk to us for an hour about links?' Yes, I am.</q><cite>Jenn Lukas</cite>
				<!-- note - I cannot even begin to replicate the enthusiasm with which Jenn presented this material, and I will make no attempt to do so. -->			
				<ul>
					<li>Hover and focus states are good for accessibility - lets users know what you can click</li>
					<li>Use of hover states has expanded to navigation lists, images, etc.</li>
					<li>Need to rethink hover on mobile because touch devices don't all necessarily support hover states, but that doesn't mean we can't have fun on desktop</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>The Essential Hover</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Simple color change on hover</li>
					<li>Adding CSS transitions fades the color more smoothly, which makes the viewing experience a little less jarring</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Surprise and delight</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Change the state of the content slightly on hover to give it a bit of movement</li>
					<li>Vary timing of when different elements change on hover</li>
					<li>Adds fun to the page without denying access to content</li>
				Gives the user a bit of a "surprise" - they probably weren't expecting the content to react to their movement
					<li>Can replace a lot of Javascript animations/hacks with CSS transitions/hovers - using <code>{}</code> instead of <code>$()</code></li>
					<li>Don't go overboard - always make sure the transitions you use are appropriate for your content</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Filters &amp; Animations</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><code><a href="http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/css/filters/index.html">-webkit-filter</a></code> property allows you to set Photoshop-like filters on images <em>using only CSS</em></li>
					<li>Applying CSS animations to elements on load brings us back to the days of web splash pages and (<em>cringe</em>) Flash, but adding animated hover states adds a bit more reaction to user interaction</li>
					<li>CSS <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/#toc-the-mask-property"><code>mask</code></a>, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/#toc-clipping-in-css-21"><code>clip</code></a>, and <a href="http://codepen.io/fernandoporazzi/pen/sdgiK"><code>background-clip</code></a> properties for additional fancy styling</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Don't lose <code>:focus</code> on content and accessibility</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure to define your <code>:focus</code> state with your <code>:hover</code> state</li>
					<li>Don't hide crucial information (menus, important details) behind hovers</li>
					<li>There are various tricks/hacks you can play around with to try and work around the hover/tap dilemma
						<ul>
							<li>Can try to toggle between showing states on hover/focus and showing them on tap for touch screens, but it is difficult to detect when to use which solution (both media queries and feature detection are imperfect)</li>
							<li>On <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/jj152135(v=vs.85).aspx">IE10 on Windows 8</a>, you can set the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-haspopup"><code>aria-haspopup</code></a> attribute to <code>true</code> lets you set an element to its hover state on tap (and removes hover state when you tap away)</li>

				<h3><a class="title" href="#meyer">Strong Layout Systems</a></h3>
				<a class="speaker" href="http://aneventapart.com/speakers/eric-meyer">Eric Meyer</a>
				<div>
				<q>In the beginning, Tim created the server... And Tim said 'Let there be markup', and there was markup, and he saw the markup, and it was good. And then he separated the structure from the appearance of the markup.</q><cite>Eric Meyer</a></cite>
				<p>In the early days of web browsing, browser defaults didn't declare exactly what things should look like; they merely <em>suggested</em> how content should render. The fundamental feature of the web was, and still is, <strong>ubiquity over consistency</strong>.</p>
				
				<p><strong>CSS1</strong> (and the box model it introduced) was an <em>appearance model</em>, not a <em>layout system</em>. But with floats and hacks, developers used it for layouts anyway.</p>
				
				<img src="img/boxmodel.jpg" alt="CSS1 box model as illustrated via cat">
				
				<p><strong>CSS2</strong> introduced positioning for layout, but this was still imperfect - elements were still unaware of the other elements around them.</p>
				
				<p><strong>The era of hacks is ending.</strong> But there's going to be a bit of a learning curve.</p>
				<h4>Viewport units</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Set width and height in "vh" and "vw" units, as a percentage of the height of the viewport rendering the page</li>
					<li>Width and height is always relative to viewport, not parent element</li>
					<li>Equivalent to <code>rem</code> for font sizing</li>
					<li>Can be applied to <em>any</em> element that accepts a length unit - such as <code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code> for font sizing</li>
					<li>Good news, everyone! <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units">Support is growing!</a></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Flexbox</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The closest we have come to uncovering the "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/holygrail">Holy Grail</a>" of CSS layout</li>
					<li>Parent container <code>display</code> set to <code>flex</code>, which then picks up <code>flex</code> or any other flexbox-specific parameters set on the child elements</li>
					<li><em>Only</em> works if parent has <code>display: flex;</code></li>
					<li>After over a decade, we can <em>finally</em> have <strong>vertically-centered, equal-height content</strong> on a web page <em>without</em> using a dirty, nasty table hack</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#justify-content-property"><code>justify-content</code></a> - even horizontal spacing without having to calculate offsets</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#align-items"><code>align-items</code></a> - keep the heights of elements even, like a table - but without a table!</li>
					<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap"><code>flex-wrap</code></a> - flow lists of items into flexible lines, without having to know the width/height of what items you are bringing in</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#order-property"><code>flex-order</code></a> - re-order content (though <code>:last-child</code> will still attach to last child in document, not in display order)</li>	
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Grids</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>For a full, robust, CSS-based layout system, you need grids</li>
					<li>Very limited browser support - may be 2 to 3 years until we see the support needed to make it viable for broad use</li>
					<li>You can set up vertical and horizontal grid lines and then "hang" elements off of them.</li>
					<li>Nest grids inside of grids, set columns within grids - gridception?</li>
					<li>Grid will just keep adding columns at a width you set, until it runs out of space</li>
					<li>Can combine with flexbox for some true CSS magic - grids within flexboxes within grids</li>
					<li>CSS syntax is a bit messy, and specs aren't fully defined yet (which may lead to varying browser interpretations down the line). 
						<ul>
							<li><code>grid-definition-columns: 50px 1fr min-content minmax(min-content, 1fr);</code></li>
							<li><code>fr</code> = fraction - setting what happens to remainder space in columns (distributed among all boxes or added all to one)</li>
							<li><code>min-content</code> = minimum width you need for content (this is not outlined fully in spec - how do we determine the minimum?)</li>
						</ul>

				<h4>Setting the Scene: The Mobile Market Today</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Look at the devices that have entered the market in the last year - increasing screen size, varying dimensions and pixels per inch</li>
					<li>In the period of only a few months, the amount and variety of devices entering the market can be overwhelming:
						<ul>
							<li>Different sizes</li>
							<li>Different pixel densities</li>
							<li>Different OS</li>
							<li>Different browsers</li>
							<li>Different inputs - touch, <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">gestures</a>, cursor, keyboard</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Initial reaction of industry was to fork content - separate mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences
						<ul>
							<li>Lines between phones and tablets are blurring now as smartphones get larger and tablets get smaller - how do we target these devices?</li>
							<li>Are tablets really mobile devices? Only 6% of 10" tablet traffic comes from cell networks</li>
							<li>Setting "cutoffs" between smartphone, tablet, and desktop becomes highly arbitrary - we have devices of every screen size available</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>One good way to divide devices is by <strong>human ergonomics</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Fits in your palm</li>
							<li>Fits in your lap</li>
							<li>Needs a desk or wall</li>
							<li>Devices may change, but humans generally aren't going to get much larger anytime soon</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Android engagement mystery</li>
						<ul>
							<li>When looking at industry stats, be sure to distinguish <em>sales</em> from <em>use</em></li>
							<li>Apple products make up 46% of tablet sales, but 91% of mobile web traffic from tablets</li>
							<li><strong>75%</strong> of smartphones shipped at the end of 2012 were Android phones, yet they made up only <strong>18%</strong> of mobile browser activity</li>
							<li><strong>15%</strong> of that same group of phones were iOS devices, which made up <strong>67%</strong> of mobile browser activity</li>

				<h4>Multi-Device Design: Executive Summary</h4>

				<div>
				<h4>Design considerations:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Content first, nav second</li>
					<li>Maintain context (don't send the user away from where they were browsing)</li>
					<li>Ergonimics of use
						<ul>
							<li>Since we are optimizing for touch, we need to think about how the user is holding the screen</li>
							<li>Posture determines which portions of the page are easiest to navigate comfortably - where you should put your interactive portions of the site</li>
							<li><strong>Bottom corners (especially bottom left) of the screen are generally most comfortable to interact with</strong></li>
							<li>Upper middle screen is least easy/comfortable to interact with</li>
							<li>Windows 8 specs recommend always putting navigation towards the edges, rather than the middle</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Simple menu options:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Bottom bar
						<ul>
							<li>Sits at bottom of screen</li>
							<li>Usually set with CSS fixed positioning - support across mobile browsers is not solid, and should not be relied on for your core experience</li>
							<li>On Android/Windows devices, your site controls sit right above physical/virtual system controls (home button, back button) - can be frustrating for users</li>
							<li>Generally should not use</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Toggle menu
						<ul>
							<li>Tap button to drop down more options</li>
							<li>Relies on CSS/Javascript to have menu appear on mobile, which is not as universal/accessible as plain HTML/anchor link solution</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Off canvas menu
						<ul>
							<li>Opened via the "Hamburglar icon" AKA "Mr. Liney"</li>
							<li>Has same accessibility drawbacks as toggle menu</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Footer anchor (bottom navigation menu with jump toggle)
						<ul>
							<li>List of options at the end of the site, once user has seen all content</li>
							<li>Doesn't leave user "hanging" at the end of page content</li>
							<li>To avoid duplicate nav (one on top, one on bottom), add anchor link to top of page to jump user down to nav at the bottom</li>
							<li>Good for content order, but some do not like the "jump" - think it makes for a jarring user experience</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Toggle/off-canvas are more user-friendly because you bring the user to content right away and keep the navigation out of the way until the user needs it</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<h4>Multi-level menu options:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Accordion-style</li>
					<li>Panel/toggle - each sub-level appears in a panel that slides away to reveal the next level - expansion of simple footer anchor or toggle menu</li>
					<li>Hubs/subs
						<ul>
							<li>Mobile version takes you to hub pages, which then present subsections</li>

					<li>In-between wireframes aren't really necessary - design point A (mobile) and point B (desktop), and let the code naturally fill in the gaps</li>
					<li>Constraints of mobile force you to focus your content, which is a good thing - prioritization</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Baseline styles for navigation, fonts, content, and images should be outside of any media queries</li>

					</li>
					<li>Build fluidly:
						<ul>
							<li>Need to consider both horizontal and vertical orientation, because tablets and smartphones switch between the two quite easily</li>
							<li>Don't try to target fixed canvas widths/heights - there isn't one set of "popular" screen sizes anymore</li>

				<h3><a class="title" href="#layout-patterns">Multi-device Layout Patterns</a></h3>
				<div>
				<ul>
					<li>Mostly fluid
						<ul>
							<li>Desktop is large screen with columns and wide left/right margins</li>
							<li>As viewport shrinks, margins decrease and columns get smaller</li>
							<li>At a certain point everything turns into one column</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Column Drop
						<ul>
							<li>Desktop is 3 columns</li>
							<li>As viewport shrinks, drops to 2 columns</li>
							<li>At a certain point everything turns into one column</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Layout shifter
						<ul>
							<li>Some site elements move as page expands</li>
							<li>Move between about 3 layouts based on space available</li>
							<li>Nav may start on the header then move to the left side on larger screens</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Tiny tweaks
						<ul>
							<li>Not a lot changes as page gets smaller</li>
							<li>Works well for landing pages without a lot of content/navigation</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://jasonweaver.name/lab/offcanvas/">Off-canvas layout</a> - things you can access are off the screen (to the left/right/above)	</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Mobile gets the "shaft" in all of these layouts - all content "stacks" into one big, long, page. We can do our best to "manage the shaft":</p>
				<ul>
					<li>CSS flexbox allows you to reorder content on mobile to reshuffle content and put most relevant info on top of screen</li>
					<li>For example, the mobile site for restaurant or theater should place location and hours info closer to the top, because that is what users are <em>usually</em> (not always) most interested in when they are acessesing that site from a mobile device</li>
					<li>People use mobile devices in different ways - need to know your users and what content they access most often from different kinds of devices</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When you structure your layouts, remember that <strong>screen size can be deceiving.</strong> The Samsung Galaxy S4 has the same screen resolution has some HDTVs, but user posture when using each device varies widely between the two. Sites viewed 10 feet away (on a TV) look a lot different than those viewed from 1 foot away (on a smartphone).</p>

				<h3><a class="title" href="hires">High Resolution</a></h3>
				<div>
				<p>Screen density poses a challenge to responsive design. More pixels in the same space means an image sized at a certain pixel width/height renders larger/smaller depending on how many pixels there are per physical square inch on a display.</p>
				
				<h4>Hi-res image options:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>CSS background images
						<ul>
							<li>Save different versions of background images/sprites, use larger versions of your background images and scale them down 50% for browsers with higher pixel densities</li>
							<li><code>@media screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) { }</code></li>
							<li>Advantage - browser will only download one image (whichever applies based on CSS)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Javascript replace
						<ul>
							<li>Data attribute in img tag that says <code>hires="true"</code> - javascript used to replace images based on this attribute</li>
							<li>Disadvantage is that both images are downloaded - browser doens't wait to see which one will actually be shown</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Compressing &amp; serving one image
						<ul>
							<li>One technique: Blur portions of image that aren't relevant to put focus on main point of image, which helps compress them further</li>
							<li>More popular technique: Start with a source image two times the size you need it, then crank compression up to a quality of 0
								<ul>
									<li>Image is jaggedy, but when scaled down 50% in the browser, you get half the file size and better quality</li>
									<li>Seems like magic, and for the most part it is</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				<li>Give people choice
					<ul>
						<li>"Standard" and "HD" views</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">Picturefill</a> polyfill</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Major issue with all of these options is that we are serving images only based on resolution of screen - no considerations for bandwidth
					<ul>
						<li>Chrome team is working on a Network Information API - would give you a sense of the bandwidth in Mb/sec, whether or not connection is metered, and will throw an "onchange" event for when the situation changes</li>
						<li>IE11 is also working on Web Performance APIs - 
							<ul>
								<li>Navigation timing to measure the perfornance of a website</li>
								<li>LazyLoad - give browser hints on the download priority of a resource</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Right now, screen resolution is our best proxy</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Resolution-independent graphics:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>CSS3 replacements for images - CSS is the most ubiquitous vector drawing tool on the web today</li>
				<li>Icon fonts such as those on <a href="http://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a> - easy to resize, change color, add shadow</li>
				<li>SVG
					<ul>
						<li>Support on mobile is Android 4+ only, has different implementations/bugs across different browsers</li>
						<li>Load in as image source (.svg file), or as an object with an image fallback
							<ul>
								<li>Issue - browsers that do not support SVG download both resources</li>
								<li>Can prevent double-downloads using a combination of CSS and object markup</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Can use as a data URI - <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon">Grunticon</a> is a good resource for using SVG on the web</li>
				<li><a href="http://timkadlec.com/2013/04/media-queries-within-svg/">Media queries</a> work inside of SVG - react to the size of the image, <em>not</em> the viewport of the browser</li>
				<li>Can embed text within SVG, and use media queries to move and resize that text - again, relative to <em>container</em>, not entire viewport</li>

			<h3><a class="title" href="#speed">Need for Speed</a></h3>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Average web page = 1.4MB, average responsive page = 1.2MB, average mobile site = 180KB</li>
				<li><strong>40%</strong> of mobile users will abandon your site if it doesn't load after 3 seconds</li>
				<li>Being responsive doesn't make a page heavier - makes your page a bit better because you really consider your page content and optimize from the content up</li>
				<li>HTTP requests are one of the biggest performance problems on the web, especially when it comes to mobile</li>
				<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/">Google PageSpeed</a> has added mobile-first page speed criteria</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Simple speed fixes:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't download and display: none</li>
				<li>Avoid complicated DOMs</li>
				<li>Eliminate redirects</li>
				<li>Use sprites/CSS3/canvas whenever possible</li>
				<li>Minify CSS/Javascript</li>
				<li>Reduce dependencies on heavy Javascript libraries</li>
				<li>Use proper HTTP headers for caching</li>
				<li>Load contents lazily</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Perception of performance:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Fake people out when your site does take time to make a connection</li>
				<li>Have the interface react instantly to user action, even if the network/server hasn't actually reacted yet</li>
				<li>Don't overdo "spinners" for loading - makes users feel like they are always waiting for content</li>
			</ul>
					
			<h4>Client-side performance enhancements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Progressive. Enhancement.</li>
				<li>Ajax-include content: Lightweight default link to additional information, on larger screens ajax request loads contents of that link directly onto the page</li>
				<li>Lazy loading/progressive load order</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Server-side performance components:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Can only send what information the client needs - serve up appropriate content based on user agent</li>
				<li>Serving up totally different templates for every device is inefficent</li>
				<li><strong>RESS</strong> = responsive web design + server side components
					<ul>
						<li>Only send what client needs on a component bases - device detection used only to swap out small portions of assets</li>
						<li>Requires a device detection system/device library to determine what's what</li>
						<li>Can be used for images/static files as well as for detecting native device functionality such as bar code scanners</li>
					</ul>
