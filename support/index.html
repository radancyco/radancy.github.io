<h2 id="web-standards">Web Standards</h2>

<img src="https://tbcdn.talentbrew.com/company/3401/v1_0/img/global/tmp-web-standards.png" class="article-image" alt="">

<p>Our development methodologies adhere to many standards and guidelines proposed by the <a href="https://www.w3c.org/" title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</a>.</p>

<p>We also embrace best practices found in the web design and development community. By using the most modern techniques at our disposal, we can craft an experience that is both engaging and accessible to all users.</p>

<p>By adopting modern principles of design and development, we can also ensure <em>stability</em>. Web sites that work well in today's modern browsers will also work well in <a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">future</a> browsers. This is the <em>promise</em> of supporting standards based development and best practices.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

<p>All of your prospective job candidates, regardless of physical or technological capabilities, have the right to learn more about your company and access all job listings. To preserve users' right of universal access, our baseline development standards for all of our web offerings <em>attempt</em> to meet as many WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA guidelines as possible. However, many aspects of accessibility touch upon how a site is designed and implemented and require a more stringent process, so if there is a need to fully support accessibility guidelines, please bring this to the attention of your account representative as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>Please note that we do not support browsers that have been modified, run in compatibility mode, or filter out code via proxy filtering, that is required for the normal operation of your site.</em></p>

<p>Our development team analyzes global <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">browser market share</a> and client web traffic data on a quarterly basis. Web browser support ends when that browser represents less than 5% of all market share and/or web traffic.</p>

<p>We do not, as a matter of course, support browsers that are not listed within this document. Should your users or company's browser needs differ, please consult your account representative immediately.</p>
