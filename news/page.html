  <h2>The Programmatic Standard.</h2>

  <p>As the labor market grows increasingly competitive and candidates become more selective, an ad buying strategy that revolves around a standard pay-per-click, publisher-by-publisher basis is neither scalable nor humanly possible. Programmatic Jobs is the new norm as it can adjust to market conditions and optimize campaigns based on your objectives (applications, hires) â€” ensuring a scalable, flexible solution that maximizes your budget and return on investment.</p>
