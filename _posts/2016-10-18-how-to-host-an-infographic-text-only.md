## Infographic Hosting 101

An inforgraphic on how to host an infographics.

### One Image

You only need one graphic. The primary purpose of an infographic is to be shared on social networks, so having multiple versions of them works against you. Use one and simply allow it to scale cross-device.

### Sharing

On your webpage, set it as an inline image. Always. We want to allow users to download or share the image.

### Linking

Link the image to itself. We can give the user another chance to access it. This is especially helpful on mobile, as it allows for greater precision to view and is another opportunity to share a direct link out to social media, too!

### Accessibility

It is strongly suggested that a text equivalent of the content in the infographic be provided and called out on the web page that is housing the inforgraphic. You can simply link to this content. This is not only great for accessibility, but for SEO, too!

### Source

It is good form to cite the original URL within the graphic itself. Should a user wish to return to the original source, then you are covered. It also allows disabled users to access the text link as well, should they need it.
